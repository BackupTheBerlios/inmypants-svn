Foolishness!
Stupid fat hobbit!
We hates the fat hobbit! Him and his pots and pans and ropes.
Thieves. Thieves all!
Stupid hobbit. Talking to himself like that. Not answering himself.
Yes. Sleep sweet sleep with our precious!
Filthy little thief playing with our precious!
If only fat hobbit would go away for a moment, we could go to master and take the precious away from him.
No! Must not take away our precious!
We miss the song of the precious. We miss it. We wants it back!
Everyone wants my precious. It's not fair! It's ours!
Shiny, shiny.
