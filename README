README for IN MY PANTS
======================

Thanks for trying IN MY PANTS (AKA "IMP" when it can't be confused with the
REAL IMP and you don't feel like saying IN MY PANTS)!

What's IMP?
===========
IMP is a set of scripts for the popular Eggdrop IRC bot, forked from bMotion.
(http://bmotion.sourceforge.net/)

IMP gives your Eggdrop bot a bit of a personality, and will probably make your
regulars and newcomers alike look at it in an odd way. Hey, it'll probably even
make YOU look at it in an odd way.

Why fork?
=========
Basically I've had a few patches which I had to keep integrating to bMotion CVS
when I wanted to upgrade. This got annoying after a while, as CVS isn't great
at merging files automatically. Hence IMP was born.

What are all of these "foo.bmotion" files?
==========================================
They're old files from bMotion - presumably I've not yet integrated the
contained information into other files yet.

So, where can I get IMP from?
=============================
IMP's homepage is http://inmypants.berlios.de/.
